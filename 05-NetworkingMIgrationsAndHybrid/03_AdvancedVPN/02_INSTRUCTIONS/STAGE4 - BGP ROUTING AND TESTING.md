# Advanced Highly-Available Dynamic Site-to-Site VPN

In this stage you will use the IPSEC tunnels created in stage 3 .. adding BGP sessions over all the tunnels.
These sessions will allow the ONPREM Routers to exchange routers with the Transit Gateway running in AWS
Once routes are exchanged, the connections will allow data to flow between AWS and ONPREMISES
BGP capability is added using `FRR` and that will be installed as part of this stage of the demo.

# STAGE 4A - INSTALL FRR ON ROUTER 1 (BGP CAPABILITY)

Move to EC2 Console
https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Instances:sort=instanceState
Click `Instances` on the left menu
Locate and select `ONPREM-ROUTER1`
Right Click => `Connect`
Select `Session Manager`
Click `Connect`

First we will make the `FRR` script executable and run it to install BGP capability.
`chmod +x ffrouting-install.sh`
`./ffrouting-install.sh`
** This will take some time - 10-15 minutes **
** We can allow this to run, and start the same process on the other Router **

# STAGE 4B - INSTALL FRR ON ROUTER 2 (BGP CAPABILITY)

Move to EC2 Console
https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Instances:sort=instanceState
Click `Instances` on the left menu
Locate and select `ONPREM-ROUTER2`
Right Click => `Connect`
Select `Session Manager`
Click `Connect`

`chmod +x ffrouting-install.sh`
`./ffrouting-install.sh`

# STAGE 4C - CONFIGURE BGP ROUTING FOR ONPREMISES-ROUTER1 AND TEST

`vtysh`
`conf t`
`frr defaults traditional`
`router bgp 65016`
`neighbor CONN1_TUNNEL1_AWS_BGP_IP remote-as 64512`
`neighbor CONN1_TUNNEL2_AWS_BGP_IP remote-as 64512`
`no bgp ebgp-requires-policy`
`address-family ipv4 unicast`
`redistribute connected`
`exit-address-family`
`exit`
`exit`
`wr`
`exit`

`sudo reboot`
